# Neural Review System

Implement spaced repetition and memory consolidation cycles for knowledge retention.

## Usage
Automatically review and strengthen knowledge connections based on neuroscience principles.

## Neural Review Protocol

### Phase 1: Memory Consolidation Analysis
```xml
<review_scope>
- Identify notes accessed in last 24h, 3 days, 1 week, 1 month
- Calculate forgetting curve intervals for each note
- Determine synaptic strength based on connection frequency
- Assess knowledge gaps requiring reinforcement
</review_scope>
```

### Phase 2: Spaced Repetition Scheduling
Execute **progressive review intervals**:
1. **Immediate review** (same day): Fresh insights and connections
2. **Short-term review** (3 days): Initial consolidation
3. **Medium-term review** (1 week): Pattern recognition
4. **Long-term review** (1 month): Deep integration
5. **Maintenance review** (3 months): Wisdom distillation

### Phase 3: Progressive Summarization
For each note in review cycle:
```xml
<distillation>
<layer_1>Original capture with source</layer_1>
<layer_2>Key passages highlighted</layer_2>
<layer_3>Essential insights bolded</layer_3>
<layer_4>Atomic concepts extracted</layer_4>
<layer_5>Meta-connections identified</layer_5>
</distillation>
```

### Phase 4: Synaptic Strengthening
- **Connection frequency tracking**: Log how often notes link together
- **Semantic similarity detection**: Find related but unlinked content
- **Emergence pattern recognition**: Identify spontaneous insight clusters
- **Knowledge gap mapping**: Discover missing links in understanding

### Phase 5: Memory Palace Creation

#### Create Neural Pathways:
```
ðŸ“‚ 03_resources/Neural_Pathways/
â”œâ”€â”€ Synaptic_Clusters_[Date].md
â”œâ”€â”€ Memory_Consolidation_Log.md
â”œâ”€â”€ Forgetting_Curve_Analysis.md
â”œâ”€â”€ Knowledge_Gap_Map.md
â””â”€â”€ Emergence_Patterns.md
```

#### Review Session Structure:
- **5 min**: Energy state assessment
- **15 min**: Spaced repetition review
- **10 min**: Connection strengthening
- **10 min**: Progressive summarization
- **5 min**: Emergence pattern recognition

### Phase 6: Adaptive Intelligence

#### Learning Velocity Optimization:
- Track review effectiveness metrics
- Adjust spacing intervals based on retention
- Identify optimal review times based on circadian rhythms
- Personalize difficulty curves for different knowledge domains

#### Cognitive Load Management:
- Limit concurrent active reviews (7Â±2 Miller's Law)
- Balance new information intake with consolidation
- Create cognitive rest periods between intensive sessions
- Monitor attention span patterns for optimal timing

## Neural Triggers
Use this command when:
- "Review my knowledge..."
- "Strengthen connections..."
- "What should I revisit..."
- "Find knowledge gaps..."
- Daily/weekly knowledge maintenance

## Success Metrics
- **Retention rate**: % of reviewed concepts recalled after intervals
- **Connection density**: Average links per note in active review
- **Insight emergence**: New connections discovered per session
- **Knowledge velocity**: Rate of deep understanding development

## Integration Points
- Link to daily planning for review scheduling
- Connect with project work for applied knowledge
- Integrate with content creation for knowledge expression
- Sync with learning goals for targeted development

## Quick Start Guide

### Daily Neural Review (15 min)
1. Run energy assessment
2. Review 3-5 notes due for spaced repetition
3. Create 2-3 new connections
4. Log insights and schedule next reviews

### Weekly Neural Maintenance (45 min)
1. Use `tpl_neural_session.md` for structured review
2. Analyze synaptic clusters and emergence patterns
3. Update knowledge gap map
4. Plan next week's review priorities

### Monthly System Evolution (90 min)
1. Complete forgetting curve analysis
2. Update memory consolidation algorithms
3. Refine templates based on usage patterns
4. Document system improvements and insights
