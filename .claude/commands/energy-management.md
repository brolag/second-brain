# Energy Management

Track, optimize, and manage your daily energy levels using data-driven insights and holistic approaches.

## Usage
Monitor energy patterns, optimize routines, and maintain sustainable productivity through energy-aware planning.

## Process
1. **Morning Energy Assessment** (5 min)
   - Rate energy level (1-10)
   - Note sleep quality and recovery
   - Check HRV and readiness metrics
   - Set energy-based priorities

2. **Energy Tracking Throughout Day**
   - Log energy levels at key intervals
   - Note energy drains and boosts
   - Track focus quality and mental clarity
   - Monitor physical energy and motivation

3. **Evening Energy Review** (10 min)
   - Analyze daily energy patterns
   - Identify energy optimization opportunities
   - Plan next day's energy strategy
   - Update health metrics

## Energy Management Framework

### Energy Zones
- **Peak Energy (8-10)**: Deep work, complex tasks, creative projects
- **High Energy (6-7)**: Focused work, meetings, learning
- **Moderate Energy (4-5)**: Routine tasks, admin, light work
- **Low Energy (1-3)**: Rest, recovery, simple tasks only

### Energy Optimization Strategies

#### Physical Energy
- **Sleep optimization**: Track sleep quality, duration, and recovery
- **Movement breaks**: 5-min walks every 25 min (Pomodoro)
- **Nutrition timing**: Energy-dense meals at peak times
- **Hydration**: Track water intake and energy correlation

#### Mental Energy
- **Focus blocks**: 90-min deep work sessions
- **Mental breaks**: 15-min recovery between blocks
- **Context switching**: Minimize task switching
- **Environment**: Optimize workspace for energy

#### Emotional Energy
- **Stress management**: Monitor stress levels and triggers
- **Social energy**: Balance social interaction and solitude
- **Gratitude practice**: Daily energy boost through appreciation
- **Boundary setting**: Protect energy from drains
