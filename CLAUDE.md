# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this second brain system.

## System Overview

This is a **Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system** using the PARA methodology enhanced with AI agents for optimized productivity and knowledge processing.

## Vault Structure

The system follows the PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive) methodology:

```
üìÇ Second Brain System
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 00_inbox/          # Quick capture and processing

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìù TODO.md         # Central task management
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # System documentation
```

## AI Command System

The system includes specialized Claude commands designed for comprehensive productivity:

### Core Commands
- **`/daily-start`** - Morning routines, task prioritization, energy management
- **`/project-focus [name]`** - Deep focus mode for specific projects with SMART goals and timeline tracking
- **`/knowledge-capture [type]`** - Information processing, connection mapping, and learning organization
- **`/framework-transformer`** - Convert ideas and content into actionable frameworks and systems

### Command Usage Strategies
Each command is optimized for specific workflows:
- **Daily planning** ‚Üí Use `/daily-start` for morning routine and task prioritization  
- **Deep work sessions** ‚Üí Use `/project-focus` for concentrated project work
- **Learning and research** ‚Üí Use `/knowledge-capture` for processing new information
- **System creation** ‚Üí Use `/framework-transformer` for building actionable frameworks
- **Content creation** ‚Üí Combine commands for comprehensive content workflows
- **System optimization** ‚Üí Regular use of all commands for workflow enhancement


## Working with this System

### Daily Workflow
1. **Morning**: Use `/daily-start` to create daily note and set priorities
2. **Work Sessions**: Use `/project-focus` for deep work on specific projects
3. **Learning**: Use `/knowledge-capture` to process new information
4. **Evening**: Update progress in daily note and plan tomorrow

### Project Management
- All projects use SMART goals methodology in `01_projects/`
- Project status tracked in `üìù TODO.md`
- Use `/project-focus` command for planning and coordination
- Regular reviews with stakeholder communication

### Knowledge Processing
- Raw input goes to `00_inbox/` for processing
- Use `/knowledge-capture` command to organize and connect information
- Processed knowledge moves to appropriate PARA folders
- MOCs (Maps of Content) in `03_resources/MOCs/` for topic organization

### Template System

Templates in `Templates/` directory for consistent content creation:
- **Projects**: SMART goal structured project template
- **Daily Notes**: Structured daily planning and reflection
- **Resources**: Knowledge capture and organization templates

## User Preferences

### Working Style
- **Energy-based scheduling** - Match task complexity to energy levels
- **Time-blocking approach** - Focused work sessions with specific outcomes
- **Framework-driven thinking** - Apply systematic approaches to problems
- **AI-enhanced processing** - Use commands to amplify cognitive capacity

### Communication Style
- **Direct and actionable** - Focus on specific next steps
- **Context-aware** - Reference existing knowledge and connections
- **Progress-oriented** - Track completion and advancement
- **Learning-focused** - Capture insights and knowledge development

### Priority Areas
- **Client project delivery** - High-quality, on-time project completion
- **Knowledge development** - Continuous learning and skill building
- **System optimization** - Improving workflows and productivity
- **Content creation** - Sharing knowledge and building authority

## Integration Points

### External Tools
- **Git** for version control and backup
- **Calendar applications** for time-blocking
- **Communication platforms** for stakeholder updates
- **Cloud storage** for backup and synchronization

### Automation
- **Daily note creation** automated through templates
- **Task prioritization** based on energy and deadlines
- **Knowledge connections** identified through AI commands
- **Progress tracking** updated through daily workflows

## Best Practices

1. **Capture first, organize later** - Use inbox for quick capture
2. **Daily system usage** - Consistent daily note creation and review
3. **Command specialization** - Use appropriate commands for specific tasks
4. **Template consistency** - Follow established templates for efficiency
5. **Regular reviews** - Weekly and monthly system optimization

## System Evolution

This is a living system that evolves based on:
- **Usage patterns** and workflow optimization
- **New tool integrations** and capabilities
- **Learning needs** and knowledge development
- **Project requirements** and client needs

When working with this system, prioritize:
- **Actionable outputs** over theoretical planning
- **Connection building** between related concepts
- **Progress tracking** with measurable outcomes
- **Knowledge transformation** from consumption to creation
