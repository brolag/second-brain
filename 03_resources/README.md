# 📚 Resources - Knowledge Base & Reference Materials

Resources are **reference materials** and **knowledge assets** that you want to preserve for future use. These items support your projects and areas but don't have specific deadlines.

## 📋 Resource Definition

A resource must have:
- ✅ **Future reference value** (not immediate action needed)
- ✅ **Supporting information** for projects or areas
- ✅ **Knowledge content** worth preserving
- ✅ **No specific deadline** (timeless reference material)

## 🤖 AI Resource Management

Use these agents for resource optimization:

```
/knowledge-capture [type]    # Process new information
/knowledge-curator          # Organize and connect resources
/framework-transformer      # Convert content to frameworks
```

## 🗺 Maps of Content (MOCs)

MOCs are **structural notes** that organize and link related resources:

### Purpose of MOCs
- **Topic overview** with links to detailed resources
- **Learning pathways** for progressive skill development
- **Connection hubs** between related concepts
- **Navigation aids** for large knowledge areas

### MOC Structure Template
```markdown
# [Topic] - Map of Content

## Overview
Brief description of the topic and its importance

## Core Concepts
- [[Fundamental Concept 1]]
- [[Fundamental Concept 2]]
- [[Fundamental Concept 3]]

## Learning Path
1. **Beginner**: Start with these resources
2. **Intermediate**: Progress to these topics
3. **Advanced**: Master these concepts

## Key Resources
- [[Important Article 1]]
- [[Essential Book Summary]]
- [[Useful Tool or Framework]]

## Related MOCs
- [[Related Topic 1]]
- [[Related Topic 2]]
```

## 🧠 Frameworks & Thinking Systems

Frameworks are **systematic approaches** to thinking and problem-solving:

### Framework Categories
- **Business Strategy** - PLG, SWOT, Business Model Canvas
- **Decision Making** - First Principles, Mental Models
- **Learning** - Spaced Repetition, Active Recall
- **Productivity** - GTD, Time Blocking, Energy Management
- **Creative** - Design Thinking, SCAMPER, Six Thinking Hats

### Framework Documentation
Each framework should include:
- **Core principles** and underlying logic
- **Step-by-step process** for application
- **Examples** of successful implementation
- **Common pitfalls** and how to avoid them
- **Integration points** with other frameworks

## 🕸 Neural Pathways System

Neural Pathways track **knowledge connections** and **learning patterns**:

### Connection Types
- **Similarity Links** - Concepts that share characteristics
- **Contrast Links** - Opposing or complementary ideas
- **Causal Links** - Cause-and-effect relationships
- **Sequential Links** - Process steps or temporal sequences
- **Hierarchical Links** - Category and subcategory relationships

### Pattern Recognition
- **Emergence Patterns** - How new insights develop
- **Forgetting Curves** - Knowledge retention analysis
- **Synaptic Clusters** - Strongly connected concept groups
- **Knowledge Gaps** - Areas needing development

## 📖 Information Processing Workflow

### Capture Phase
1. **Raw input** goes to `00_inbox/`
2. **AI processing** with `/knowledge-capture`
3. **Initial categorization** and tagging
4. **Quality assessment** for retention value

### Processing Phase
1. **Content analysis** and key insight extraction
2. **Connection identification** with existing knowledge
3. **Classification** into appropriate resource category
4. **Template application** for consistent structure

### Integration Phase
1. **MOC updates** with new resource links
2. **Framework connections** and applications
3. **Neural pathway** documentation
4. **Cross-references** with projects and areas
