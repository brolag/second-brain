# 🚀 Getting Started Guide

Welcome to your AI-Enhanced Second Brain! This guide will get you up and running in 15 minutes.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- **Claude Code** installed and configured
- **Git** for version control
- **Text Editor** (VS Code, Obsidian, or your preference)
- **15 minutes** for initial setup

## 🎯 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Clone and Initialize
```bash
# Clone the template
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/second-brain-template.git my-second-brain
cd my-second-brain

# Initialize your repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial second brain setup"
```

### 2. Test AI Integration
```bash
# Test that Claude Code can access your system
/daily-start

# This should create your first daily note
```

### 3. Quick Personalization
- Open `CLAUDE.md` and add your name and focus areas
- Update `📝 TODO.md` with your current priorities
- Create your first project folder in `01_projects/`

## 🔧 Basic Configuration (10 Minutes)

### Personal Information
Edit `CLAUDE.md` to include:
- Your name and role
- Your primary focus areas and projects
- Your preferred working hours
- Your key tools and platforms

### AI Agents Setup
The system includes 44 specialized agents. Start with the core 6:
- **Daily Coordinator** - Morning routines and task prioritization
- **Project Manager** - SMART goals and milestone tracking
- **Knowledge Curator** - Information processing and connections
- **Technical Architect** - System design and technology decisions
- **Research Assistant** - Market analysis and fact-checking
- **Content Creator** - Writing and documentation

### Custom Commands
Test these essential commands:
```bash
/daily-start                    # Create daily note with AI planning
/project-focus [project-name]   # Deep focus mode for projects
/knowledge-capture idea "Your brilliant insight here"
/framework-transformer          # Convert learnings to frameworks
```

## 📁 Understanding the Structure

### PARA Methodology
Your system follows Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive:

```
📂 Your Second Brain
├── 📥 00_inbox/          # Quick capture (process daily)
├── 🎯 01_projects/       # Active outcomes (review weekly)
├── 🏠 02_areas/          # Ongoing responsibilities (review monthly)
├── 📚 03_resources/      # Reference materials (grow continuously)
├── 📦 04_archive/        # Completed items (access occasionally)
└── 📅 05_daily/          # Daily notes (use daily)
```

### AI Enhancement Layer
```
📂 .claude/
├── agents/               # 44 specialized AI assistants
├── commands/             # Custom slash commands
├── prompts/              # System prompts and templates
└── mcp-servers/          # Advanced integrations
```

## 🎨 First Day Workflow

### Morning (10 minutes)
1. Run `/daily-start` to create today's note
2. Set your top 3 priorities for the day
3. Block time in your calendar for focused work

### During the Day
- Capture ideas quickly in `00_inbox/`
- Use `/knowledge-capture` for articles and insights
- Use `/project-focus` for dedicated project work

### Evening (5 minutes)
1. Review your daily note
2. Process items from your inbox
3. Plan tomorrow's priorities

## 🔄 Weekly Rhythm

### Monday - Planning
- Review all active projects
- Set weekly goals and priorities

## 🤖 Working with AI Agents

### Single Agent Tasks
```bash
# Research a topic
/research-assistant "competitive analysis of productivity apps"

# Get writing help
/content-creator "help me write a project proposal"

# Technical decisions
/technical-architect "choose between React and Vue for this project"
```

### Multi-Agent Workflows
```bash
# Product development
/trend-researcher → /rapid-prototyper → /ui-designer → /growth-hacker

# Content creation
/research-assistant → /content-creator → /visual-storyteller
```

## 📈 Success Metrics

After your first week, you should see:
- **Daily Notes** created consistently
- **Inbox Processing** happening regularly
