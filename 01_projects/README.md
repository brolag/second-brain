# 🎯 Projects - Active Outcomes & Deliverables

Projects are **specific outcomes** you're working to achieve with **clear deadlines** and **measurable results**. This is where active work happens.

## 📋 Project Definition

A project must have:
- ✅ **Specific outcome** or deliverable
- ✅ **Clear deadline** (not ongoing)
- ✅ **Measurable success criteria**
- ✅ **Active work** required

## 🏗 Project Structure Template

Each project folder should contain:

```
📁 Project_Name/
├── 📄 README.md              # Project overview & status
├── 📋 project_plan.md        # SMART goals & timeline
├── 📊 progress_tracking.md   # Milestones & metrics
├── 📞 stakeholder_comms.md   # Client/team communication
├── 🎯 deliverables/          # Final outputs
├── 📝 meeting_notes/         # Project meetings
├── 📊 research/              # Project-specific research
└── 🔧 resources/             # Tools, templates, assets
```

## 🤖 AI Project Management

Use these agents for project optimization:

```
/project-focus [project-name]    # Deep focus session
/project-manager                 # Planning & tracking
/daily-coordinator              # Task prioritization
```

## 🎯 SMART Goals Framework

Every project should define:

- **Blocker identification** and resolution
- **Resource reallocation** as needed
- **Timeline adjustments** based on progress

### Project Health Indicators
- 🟢 **On Track** - Meeting timeline and quality standards
- 🟡 **At Risk** - Potential delays or quality issues
