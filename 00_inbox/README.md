# 📥 Inbox - Quick Capture Zone

The inbox is your **first-line capture system** for all incoming information, ideas, and tasks before they get properly organized into the PARA system.

## 🎯 Purpose

- **Rapid capture** without breaking focus
- **Temporary storage** before processing
- **Daily consolidation** hub for scattered thoughts
- **AI-enhanced processing** with knowledge extraction

## 📋 What Goes Here

### Daily Inputs
- ✅ **Quick ideas** during meetings or conversations
- ✅ **Article links** to read and process later
- ✅ **Random thoughts** that might be valuable
- ✅ **Meeting notes** before proper documentation
- ✅ **Photos and screenshots** for later analysis

### Temporary Items
- ❌ **Long-term projects** (use `01_projects/`)
- ❌ **Reference materials** (use `03_resources/`)
- ❌ **Completed tasks** (archive or delete)

## 🤖 AI-Enhanced Processing

Use these commands to transform inbox items:

```
/knowledge-capture idea "Your raw thought here"
/knowledge-capture article "Article URL or content"
/knowledge-capture meeting "Meeting notes or transcript"
```

## 📅 Daily Processing Routine

### Morning Review (5 minutes)
1. **Scan yesterday's captures** for urgent items
2. **Quick sort** into actionable vs reference
3. **Tag items** for AI processing priority

### Evening Processing (15 minutes)
1. **Process all captures** from the day
2. **Move items** to appropriate PARA folders
3. **Create tasks** in TODO.md for actionable items
4. **Archive or delete** processed items

## 🏷 Tagging System

Use consistent tags for AI processing:

- `#urgent` - Needs immediate attention
- `#project/[name]` - Related to specific project
- `#idea` - Creative or business ideas
- `#research` - Needs further investigation
- `#reference` - Future reference material
- `#process` - Needs AI transformation
